I am basically going to stop being childish, this group has become too fucked up of a generation. Do what ever you want AntiMinefortclub, I don't give a shit. In the end, your being childish by raiding minefort. No one is forcing you to play on minefort. You can leave all you want. You chose to stay because your childish needs are telling you to do this and that. Grow up and be a mature person. If you really think minefort shouldn't be a thing, take it to court with them. You have rights to do so if its a reasonable cause. If you can't be the mature person than don't even call yourself AntiMinefortclub, it sounds very childish.
Take it from me, I don't like minefort for doing this but doesn't mean you should take it into your own hands, its life. Life ain't fair and will never be. Best of luck to you all.
